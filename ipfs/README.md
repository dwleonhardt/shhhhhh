## What is IPFS?
The Interplanetary File System, or IPFS, is a protocol for file storage. Files are hashed before storage, with the optional addition of asymmetric encryption. Files are then stored on a peer-to-peer network and can be shared securely.

## Basic Setup
1. Clone down this repo and run `cd research/ipfs`.
1.
